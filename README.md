# Final Project: UNO

#### Description:I recently undertook the challenge of programming a game of Uno, using my coding skills against the animated charm of Donald Duck. I crafted the game's logic, interface, and functionality to simulate the classic Uno experience. As the virtual cards were dealt and played, Donald Duck, in all his animated glory, became an unexpected and entertaining opponent in this digital duel. The  iconic Disney character engaging in a strategic card game added a twist to the coding journey. Uno is a vibrant and fast-paced card game that combines elements of strategy and luck. The deck consists of cards in four colors (red, yellow, green, and blue), each featuring numbers from 0 to 9 and special action cards like Skip, Reverse, and Draw Two. The objective is to be the first to play all your cards by matching either the color or number of the discard pile's top card. Players can strategically use action cards to disrupt opponents' progress or protect themselves. The wild cards allow players to change the current color, adding an extra layer of unpredictability. Uno is known for its simplicity, yet it offers dynamic gameplay, keeping players engaged as they strive to shout "Uno!" before someone else does and ultimately emerge victorious in this lively card game. I had to write functions for the bot as well as myself. The whole program was a big loop and I had to write a lot of individual functions to keep being called in the main loop. For decisions I picked python because it was just the nicest programming interface rather than other programs like C. I wrote only one file which is uno.py where all the code is. I was thinking about doing my final project making a clothing brand website but it I didn't have any clothes I could put up. I could have just made the default for it but I decided to do an Uno game. The card class represents a Uno card with attributes for color, rank, and card type. The __init__ method initializes the card based on its rank and assigns a color and card type accordingly. The __str__ method returns a string representation of the card. The deck class represents a Uno deck with cards.The __init__ method populates the deck with Uno cards based on colors and ranks. The __str__ method returns a string representation of the deck. The shuffle method shuffles the deck. The deal method deals a card from the deck. The hand class represents a player's hand in the game. The __init__ method initializes an empty hand with attributes to track the number of cards and their types. The class has methods to add, remove, and display cards in the hand. The game functions are choose_first: Randomly determines which player starts first, single_card_check: Checks if a card can be played based on the top card's color, rank, or if it's an action card without color, full_hand_check: For the automated player (Donald Duck), checks if there's any valid card to play from the entire hand, win_check: Checks if a player's hand is empty, indicating a win, and last_card_check: Checks if the last card played is a number card. The game loop initializes the deck, shuffles it, and deals cards to the player and Donald Duck. Players take turns playing or drawing cards until someone wins or the game ends. The game includes logic for actions like skipping turns, reversing the order, drawing cards, and changing colors. After each round, the players are prompted to play again.
